    <h1>Genetically modified cat</h1>
    <p>He looks like normal gray cat, but has a piercing gaze of emerald green eyes.
        Can talk human language, smart (IQ 160), millionaire. He can stimulate and manipulate minds of other people and animals 
        using his invented device. With its high-tech brain, Meowsk 
        can process data at quantum speeds, solving even the most complex problems in the blink of an eye—making it an 
        invaluable companion for traders and developers alike.</p>
        
    <h1>The story of cat Meowsk</h1>
    <p>Neuroscientist works on medicine that regrows neurons by genetically modifying mice. He normally tests the drug on mice, but decides to test the latest version on his cat who had injured brain. The cat’s brain regrows and, moreover,

    <p>Meowsk, using his brilliant mind, has invented a groundbreaking device: The Quantum Translator. It’s a sleek, high-tech gadget with an almost otherworldly design—shaped like a combination of a headphones-stars with antennae. The device is capable of stimulating the brainwaves of humans and animals, 
        allowing them to absorb knowledge at an exponential rate or even altering their perception and behavior in the blink of an eye.</p>
